Shallow Neural Net

Unfinished Deep Neural Net

Unfinished varying implementations of a neural net differing on level of OOP, may finish later but if I can do it without OOP in c++ then
doing it with the compartmentalization of OOP will be that much easier, what I do have at least for these files is the data structures, operators, skeletons etc, I just don't want to spend the time implementing them when I could work on something new I don't already know about. 

# Python

Feed Forward Neural Net
  Variable width and depth feed forward neural network outputting binary with sigmoid function and SGD
    
RNN
  
  Vanilla RNN: Char level vanilla RNN, takes in text files.
  
  LSTM: Unfinished from scratch LSTM

Genetic Algorithm in progress
  
  Lesson0: Password guessing with simple mutation, pre extraction of genetic engine
  
  Lesson1: Password guessing with use of a genetic engine module, adition of a chromosome object and integration into engine
  
  Lesson2: Conversion from using strings to list to generalize engine for other projects, objective of lesson is to maximize a binary list

# Data

So far I have been working from MNIST csv files, which can be found by googling "mnist csv"
