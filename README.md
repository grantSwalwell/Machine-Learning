# Embedding

  Functions for getting relevant GloVectors from wiki embedding and soon to be a numpy implementation of GloVec
  
# Encoder Decoder

  Keras encoder/decoder lstm, unfinished
  
# Genetic Algorithm
  
  Have not covered recomibnation but have gone over some of the basis of optimization through mutation. 

# LSTM 

  Long short term memory in numpy 

# Neural Net

  Variable width and depth feed forward neural net in numpy optimized with SGD.
  
# RNN
  
  Recurrent neural net in numpy.
    
# Text Tokenize

  Functions for rather quickly tokenizing and processing text for use in NLP. Word2toke and sen2toke is quite functional.
  
# Variational Auto Encoder

  Recreating a keras implementation of a variational auto encoder, however the code from the guide does not work on my computer so I am troubleshooting. 

# Workspace

  General testing area
  


# Disclaimer

  These are about half original, I piece together implementations from different sources rewriting and refactoring line by line. No copy and pasting here.
